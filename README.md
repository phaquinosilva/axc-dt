# Approximate Computing applied to Decision Tree learning

This repo contains files used in research developed in the Embedded Computing Lab at UFSC (ECL/UFSC), as part of programs in Scientific and Technological Innovation Initiation PIBIC and PIBITI (CNPq). Currently being continued as a conclusion project for a B.Sc in Computer Science at UFSC.

The goal of this project is to develop approximate arithmetic and comparison blocks, as well as workflows, to be applied in Decision Tree model construction and usage, focusing on low-power operation.
